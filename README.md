# relationship wrapped
PASSWORD, WITH THE DUMMY DATA = loveyouidiot
i made this website to show all the stats and memories from my chat history. it looks kinda like spotify wrapped but for relationships.

it shows things like:
- who texts more
- how many messages per month
- funny moments
- photos
- a map of where we've been

## how to use it

if you want to use this for your own chats, you can. here is how:

1. first you need to download your chat history (like from whatsapp)
2. you need to make a file called data.json and put it in the public folder. look at the example file i put there to see how it should look.
3. run these commands:

npm install
npm run dev

then go to localhost:3000 in your browser.

## privacy

your data stays on your computer. if you put this on the internet, make sure you put a password on it or something because it has all your personal messages in it.
